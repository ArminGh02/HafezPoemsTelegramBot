## About
This is a simple Telegram Bot made mostly for learning purposes.
It is written in Python using **[python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)** library. You can find it in Telegram via **[this link](https://t.me/hafez_poems_bot)**.

## Features

### Search for Poems
The bot enables you to search in all **[Hafez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez)** poems in two ways:
- search for one line of poem that consists of all words of query
- search for certain words that appeared in one line of poem in the specified order and consecutively

First one is done by simply entering the desired words in any order.

And the second is done by surrounding your words with double quotes. (In both ways, the bot acts similar to what Google does.)

The result of your search can be set (via commands) to either return the whole poem or only the matching line

### Get a Random Poem
There is a command to get a random poem.
